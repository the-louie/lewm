# LEWM - Louies ESP Wireless Monitor
Super basic code (in the earlist of stages) for pinging the local gateway, checking RSSI and reporting it
via MQTT.
The idea is to only test the wireless link between the client and the Wifi-AP, other tests is better performed
by other hosts in the network.

# TODO
* Clean the code up and refactor it inte "readable" chunks
